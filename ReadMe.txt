//Instructions
Modify the Election App in the following ways (note firefox often works better than other browsers for local file development)

x Add a column to the results table to calculate the percent of total votes received (should be to the right of vote counts)
x Dynamically reorder the list of candidates based on number of votes received (the candidate with the most votes should be at the top of the list)
x. Allow the user to add a new candidate so that the candidate will show up in the results and user can cast votes (use the existing stub  Election.Candidate.Component).
x. In the manage candidates component list the current candidates and give the user the ability to delete a candidate from the race.
5. Implement Styling to make the application look more professional and user friendly
